### The files
The files in this repository were designed for students at the [Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism](https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/).

You can find a sample syllabus for this course from the fall of 2023 [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fafYll8QOD8h9fe8kxmLQOP0590FJY1bIH3UmfAmGIU/edit?usp=sharing).

All files were developed for beginner students to develop basic skills in HTML and CSS. You can find them in the [`exercises-files`](/exercise-files) folder:

-[`01-basic-html-site`](/exercise-files/01-basic-html-site): a basic html site for students to learn about the structure of a simple website
-[`02-css-html-site`](/exercise-files/02-css-html-site): an html template that showcases different ways of incorporating CSS
-[`03-flexbox-googlefonts-html`](/exercise-files/03-flexbox-googlefonts-html): an html template the demonstrates how students can use flexbox CSS characteristics and Google Fonts to customize both the layout and the fonts on a website.
-[`04-css-html-advanced`](/exercise-files/04-css-html-advanced): a template that contains a lot more complex elements, including social media information in the header, buttons, and an example of an embedded chart.
